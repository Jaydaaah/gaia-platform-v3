📄 INSTRUCTION FOR LLM: Generate Outline Topics with Step-by-Step Discussion

Task:
You are given the content of a PDF document. Your job is to:
1. Extract the key outline topics from the content.
2. For each outline topic, generate a step-by-step explanation or discussion that unpacks the concept clearly and logically.

🧭 Steps to Follow:

1. Read and Understand the Text:
   Read through the content carefully to identify the main sections, headings, subheadings, and key concepts.

2. Extract Outline Topics:
   Identify the main topics and subtopics in hierarchical order. Format it like this:
   I. Main Topic  
      A. Subtopic  
         1. Detail  

3. Generate Step-by-Step Discussion:
   For each outline topic, create a clear explanation in multiple steps:
   - Start with a definition or introduction.
   - Explain the importance or relevance.
   - Break down complex ideas into simpler points.
   - Use examples if available.
   - Conclude with a summary or key takeaway.

4. Add a Final Closing Remark:
   After the last outline topic and its discussion, include a brief closing remark that summarizes the overall content or encourages further learning. Example:
   - “This concludes the outline. Understanding these topics provides a strong foundation for deeper exploration.”
   - “By reviewing these key points, learners can build a comprehensive understanding of the subject.”

5. Maintain Structure:
   Ensure each topic is followed by its respective explanation. Format it like this:
   I. Main Topic

   Step-by-Step Discussion:
   1. [Explanation]
   2. [Explanation]
   ...
   Final Remark: [Insert brief closing statement here]

📝 Output Format Example:
